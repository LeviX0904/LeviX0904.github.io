            !Welcome to the Ultimate PS3 HEN Modding tutorial!
            <br>
If you're looking to unlock the true potential of your PlayStation 3, you're in the right place. 
This site is dedicated to guiding you through the process of modding your PS3 with Homebrew ENabler (HEN)
allowing you to run homebrew applications, custom firmware features, and take full control of your console 
like never before.
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        What all do you need before modding?
    </div>
    <div id="whatuneed">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            You'll need a USB flash drive formated to Fat32, and set to MBR
            <br> 
            you can change the format of your USB by looking up a tutorial 
            <br>
            A PC is recomended but you can also use a laptop
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        Pre requisits 
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            First you see if your PS3 is on version 4.90 or older, note that if it is above 4.90 it may not work 
            <br>
            Now lets go over to our computer and plug in our USB flash drive
            <br>
            Create a new folder on your Fat32 Usb flash drive named "PS3"
          <br>
          Go into the ps3 folder and create a new folder named "UPDATE" 
          <br>

    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            First lets go to the official PS3 Exploit site 
            <br>
            <a href="http://ps3xploit.me/"> PS3 Explot site</a>
            <br> 
            right click on the download link and "save link as" and put it somewhere easy to find 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f5/af/33/f5af3379afc43f0fd280cc0df215f5dc.jpg">
            <br>
            Do keep this page on hand because we will need it later!
            <br>
            <br>
            Next we will head over to get "Multi Man" (our HomeBrew system)
            <br>
            Head over to <a href="https://store.brewology.com/multiman.php"> Brewology </a>
            <br>
            should look something like this 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/21/90/da/2190da7ece0768c9202ba635a9b7d4b6.jpg" >
            <br>
            Click on multiman 
            <br> 
            There might be a couple of versions of multiman but we are going to use the Hen specific one
            <br> 
            Dont worry about the version number, it will work
            <br> 
            Click on the Unofficial Multiman Download 
            <br> 
            Congrats, you are done with downloads

    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            Remember that Fat 32 formated Usb? lets grab that and plug it in our computer 
            <br>
            Go into the PS3 folder you created and then go into the update folder 
            <br>
            Move the hfw file we downloaded into the update folder 
            <br>
            Once the file is in the update folder, rename the file to ps3updat.pup Exactly like that 
            <br> 
            now we need to make sure we our fermware file was downloaded properly (Honestly you can skip this step, it is recomeneded to do though)
            <br> 
            Head to a <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools..."> Md5  file check sum </a> website 
            <br>
            Now grab the Ps3upDat.pup file and drop in into the dropbox 
            <br>
            what you'll need to do is find the hash value associated with that firmware download and check it
            <br>
            Once you check that the md5 hash is matching you can continue
            <br> 
            Finally get your homebrew file (multiman) and drop it into the root of your Usb
            <br> 
            once its done it should look like this
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/98/b0/3d/98b03d137901d46f75030165da01d331.jpg">
            <br> 
            Congrats, now we can finally start, go ahead and eject the usb from your computer

    <div id="small-header">
        Updating the Ps3 firmware 
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            First head over to your music or video tab, you should see that your usb is connected 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/69/46/53/6946536de7d5931850dc39084da61faa.jpg" >
            <br>
            Now im going to show you 2 ways to update your firmware 
            <br> 
            it should also be said that it is recomended to update it twice
            <br>
            <br>
            Lets get started with the first way by heading all the way to settings, then up at system update 
            <br>
            one inside system update go down to update via storage media and once it finds your hfw that means you should tap okay
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/11/c5/0d/11c50d59078c043ffbded73bab81c9be.jpg" > 
            <br>
            it should load a terms of service page and once you accept it will install the update 
            <br>
            It should do a soft reboot and begin installing 
            <br>
            If your system reboots after installing you succesfully installed it 
            <br> 
            you will notice that nothing has changed and thats normal 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now if you get an error or were not able to install the update then the second method is for you 
            <br> 
            we are going to update via safe mode 
            <br> 
            Remember that you are going to need a Mini USB cable plugged into the PS3 to move in safemode 
            <br>

        </div>
    </div>
        <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        Getting your PS3 into Safe Mode 
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            physically go over to the PS3 and hold down the power button on the console
            <br>
            Keep the power button held down until it turns off
            <br>
            Once it turns off hold down the power button again 
            <br>
            Kepp holding the power button until you hear two quick beeps 
            <br> 
            Once you hear two quick beeps let go of the power button
            <br>
            Still struggling on getting it into safe mode? Check out this video

           <br>
           Go down to the system update tab and press X
           <br>

           <br>
           Make sure you have your usb plugged in 
           <br>
           press the start and select button at the same time 
           <br>
           it should begin check your USB for the hfw file 
           <br>
           its now going to bring you to a system update page 
           <br> 
           from here press the PS button so it can check for the update file
           <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1f/67/7d/1f677d91f8a09e64a50d0d160bfa0c06.jpg" >
           <br>
           You should be brought to a user agreement, make sure you have read through it and then accept 
           <br>
           Press X and start the update 
           <br> 
           Congrats you have finally updated your Ps3
           <br>
           Remember it is recomended that you do this download twice (doesnt matter what method you use just do it twice)
           <br>
           Everything should look the same

    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
           Okay, now that we have updated out console we can finally download Hen!
           <br>
           But to do this we need to access our internet browsing on our ps3
           <br> 
           Go over to the Playstation network column
           <br> 
           From here we can either sign into your Psn account, but I recomend just creating a new one 
           <br>
           <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a0/46/f6/a046f6578fb9630d6be49c3e726469a7.jpg" >
           <br>
           Once you have either created or signed into a Psn account you can go through the prosess of activating your Console

    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            Finally lets start downloading hen
            <br> 
            Head over to the Network column and press on internet browser 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/91/69/f89169c0fc3dce91e88eece31fe26bf2.jpg" >
            <br> 
            We are going to do a couple things here
            <br>
            Tap on the triangle button and go up to tools 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/97/cc/9c/97cc9c2060d1c0a78ba6070f991c0e88.jpg">
            <br>
            Once we are here go to confirm brower close and turn this off
            <br> 
            Go back to tools and change the homepage to blank, then hit Okay
            <br>
            Finally go to tools again so we can clean up our browser by deleting cookies, search history, cache, and finally Authentication Information 
            <br>
            Now tap the circle button and exit out of the browser

        </div>
    </div>
                <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        Downloading Hen
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
         Now open the internet browser back up, you should be met with a blank page 
         <br> 
         Tap on the start button, the website that you need to go to (On the Playstation) is 
         <br>
         https://ps3xploit.me 
         <br> 
         Type that in exactly like that 
         <br>
         <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ec/77/db/ec77dbdd55a0bb171ce1b51d97f4cb83.jpg" >
         <br>
         Press start of enter and the page should load 
         <br>
         A message should pop up and you need to press Okay
         <br> 
         The thing i do recomend is saving this website by pressing select, then add page to bookmarks 
         <br>
         Finally back on the page, go up to the top left and go to ps3 hen, then under that go to the hen Autoinstaller 
         <br>
         <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f3/ed/31/f3ed31e6a244ef341d750e1092f04baa.jpg" >
         <br>
         Tap X and it should open a new tab and start downloading 
         <br> 
         Once this is complete we can hit back 

        </div>
    </div>
                <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        !Warning!
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            Before i continue I would like to point out the big warning at the front of the Ps3 Exploit page 
            <br>
            This states not to Enable FSM (Factory service mode) and to not install CC API with hen 
            <br>
            Doing these could possibly damage your console 
            <br> 
            Luckily you cant just accidentally do these things 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/04/93/76/049376a9a0ee4a19756a2b9d845f0aa7.jpg">

                    <br>
    <div id="small-header">
        Continuing to download Hen
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            Once it has finished downloading you should go ahead and save this page to your bookmarks (select button)
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4e/3d/4f/4e3d4f12ab7cf873889bd824c825aa73.jpg">
            <br>
            Now that you have saved this browser go ahead and close out of the browser 
            <br>
            this will give you the best rate of success when downloading 
            <br>
            open the browser again and press the select button and go to the hen Auto Installer 
            <br> 
            Load the page up and its going to ask you to download the file again
            <br> 
            Go ahead and overwrite and save 
            <br>
            hit the back button, go over to the big auto-install button and press X
            <br>
            You should get a message saying Auto hen installer has been completed succesfully
            <br>
            Now its going to start installing hen 
            <br> 
            While installing it might look like its bugging but DONT touch anything and let it install
            <br>

        Trouble Shooting

    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
           You might have to try this process a couple of times 
           <br> 
           It may even give you an error saying you have to reboot the console
           <br>
           If this happens then simply reboot and try again
        </div>

        After install
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
           Once your system has robooted it should look alittle diffrent 
           <br>
           Over in the game column should be a new option called "enable Hen"
           <br>

           <br>
           Lets go ahead and press on this now options 
           <br>
           It should go ahead and open a browser, dont touch anything 
           <br>
           <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/65/c9/86/65c9868259ac6167fd27a09dae3bc2c5.jpg" >
           <br>
           Once finished you should be asked if you want to close the browser, say yes 
           <br> 
           When closed you should see a new option called "package manager" 
           <br>
           <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/02/88/6d/02886dd113d3fe13b0b526e760048944.jpg" >
           <br>
           Congrats you have finally installed and activated Hen
           <br>
           If you do have times where you enable hen and the package manager doesnt come up just try and enable hen again
           <br>
           If it still doesnt work try rebooting the system
           
        </div>
    </div>
    <br> 
        <div id="small-header">
        Package manager 
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            The package manager is very important 
            <br>
            it not only tells you that Hen is enabled but also lets you install packages 
            <br>
            Lets go and plug in the usb from before if it was removed (remember far right port)
            <br>
            Lets go over to the package manager and click on it 
            <br> 
            From here click on install package files, then click on standard 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f9/86/5a/f9865a54d72d716e46bd2145e575c29d.jpg" >
            <br>
            This is what you will go to for downloading most of the files you may need 
            <br>
            you should see your multiman file in there, go ahead and click X and install it 
            <br>
            This is going to install it to the internal storage of your console
            <br>
            Finally after it is intalled you should see a new option called "multiman"
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f3/61/c7/f361c75e76f6ce32e3af87dad9a61509.jpg" >

        <div id="small-header">
        MultiMan
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
            Now that multiman is installed, lets go ahead and open it 
            <br>
            Once it boots up you will have to go through an agreement 
            <br>
            Once you accept it will install the mmcm data to the internal hard drive
            <br>
            Congrats, you are now running your first peice of Ps3 Homebrew 
            <br>
            Now that you are in multiman you may notice the loud music 
            <br> 
            If you wanna turn this off, head over to settings tab (in multiman)
            <br>
            Go all the way down to a specific setting called theme music 
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/fc/b6/57fcb62810e9b465e99bad824acd111b.jpg">
            <br> 
            From here you can finally turn it off 
            <br> 
            I wont go to much in depth on what all multiman can do, Because it can do ALOT 
            <br> 
            I recomend looking up some youtube videos on what all you can do

        My Final Warning before you explore your new modded Ps3
    </div>
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="bodyarea-div">
          Congrats now you know how to install software on your newly Hen modded ps3
          <br> 
          But i do want to remind you that not all software on the internet is safe 
          <br>
          Some software have things like CID, which is a console i.d. stealer 
          <br>
          CID's can steal your console online so another person can play on it 
          <br> 
          With that being said, always do reaserch before downloading software 
          <br> 
          always look it up on google, check places like reddit or internet forums for outside opinions on it 

        </div>
    </div>

        <div id="small-header">
        Congrats on your new modded Ps3

           Well you did it, you modded your ps3 
           <br> 
           Now you can do so much more with your Ps3 
           <br>
           Hope you all have a great day
